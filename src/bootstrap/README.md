# Bootstrap

These are React wrappers for Bootstrap "components" if you will.

## Spinner

Spinners are with configurable options found in `props`

Spinners can be centred with flexbox, and the `centered` prop will do this

## Toast

Toasts are notifications. Toasts in React are a big complicated to make. The current system only supports one at a time.
