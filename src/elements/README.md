# Elements

These are HTML Element wrappers for React

## IFrame
The iframe component in this context is for YouTube Videos. This wrapper allows spinners to be specified so there is indication of loading as the video loads.

## Image
The image component is for images (obviously). This image element takes a string or array of strings for `src`, and loads a backup source if the one before it fails. There is also a "default image", which is just a grey square.
